# Pre-Authentication
Voice Recognized Phrase Credentials

All intertested, please see the attached word doc for a brief explanation of pre-authentication via Voice Recognized Phrase Credentials.  If you're like me then you take your internet security and privacy into consideration with just about all you may do online.  We take extra measure to protect our user accounts on our favorite sites and apps all the while still seeking to streamline it.  It's just our nature to want faster, stronger stuff I guess. 

The attached word doc is a general explanation of the pre-authentication app concept utilizing VRPC.  The idea came to me yesterday and it's obviously a good solid foundation to start building on.  To see an app like the concieved come to pass, and utilized by many as a common everyday thing is the end goal.

Thank you for reading!
